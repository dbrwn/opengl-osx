Learnings and experiments with OpenGL 3 on OS X 10.9

Source files for OS X 10.9 to follow along in Jason L. McKesson's book [Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming](http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/index.html).  In this adaptation of the tutorial's examples, I am attempting to use the modern OpenGL 3 interfaces and use the newer OS X 10.9 libraries before loading up additional utility packages.  In my initial exploration of OpenGL on OS X, I found it remarkably difficult to find examples that were not dependent on deprecated functions and libraries.

Chances are good that I am doing several things wrong in these examples.  If you see opportunities for improvement, please let me know.
